# üé¨ CGR Room Scraper

CGR cinemas do not provide a straightforward way to view which movies are
assigned to which rooms, as this information is only revealed during the booking
process.

This project retrieves movie showtimes and room details from CGR cinemas and
compiles them into a structured CSV file. The goal is to offer a clearer
overview of the schedule, making it easier to analyze screenings without having
to browse film by film on the official site.
